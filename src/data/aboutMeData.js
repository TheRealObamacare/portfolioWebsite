I am currently learning advanced Neural Networks in Python and have a new project that is focusing on the basics of LLM\'s. Currently I have explored Machine Learning using SK-learn and Neural Networks by creating my own classes that are meant to be similar to PyTorch, allowing me to fully understand what I am doing.',
